<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The slider puzzle is a classic logic game that challenges a player to
 slide tiles on a board to form a picture or pattern. You may not lift 
any tile off the board; you can only slide a tile up, down, right or 
left. You must use strategy and logic to find a sequence of moves that 
will allow you to unscramble the tiles and solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>This digital Slider Puzzle provides a fun context for young learners 
(and beginning Sugar users) to explore basic functions of the Sugar on 
your Laptop, learn individual and collaborative problem-solving skills, 
and developcreative projects that reflect an understanding of curriculum
 they are studying.</p>
<p>Throughout the school year, the Slider Puzzle activity can be 
integrated into different subject areas (i.e. geography, math, creative 
writing).  Students can make puzzle images relating to a subject the 
class is studying, and share them with peers. In the process they will 
also learn how to use and integrate the output from activiites like 
Paint and Record, and how to collaborate over the Mesh.</p>

<h2>Puzzle-Solving Contest<a class="headerlink" href="#puzzle-solving-contest" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Working in teams of 2-3 people, try to solve a 9-tile Slider Puzzle 
in the fastest time. Each team must select the same image, and click on 
it at the same time (Count: “3, 2, 1, GO!”).  The timer indicates who 
finishes first.</p>
<p>The winning team should share their strategies with the class. Each 
team member should say one thing about how they solved the puzzle 
quickly and worked together.</p>
<p>Other students should describe their strategies too. Encourage 
everyone to name one way their puzzle solving skills have improved since
 the first time they played.</p>
<p>Repeat the contest with a 12 and 16 tile puzzle. Allow the winner of 
the preceding round to choose the puzzle image. Does the strategy change
 when there are more puzzle tiles to move? How?</p>

<h2>“Our Flag” (Group learning project example)<a class="headerlink" href="#our-flag-group-learning-project-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Skills:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Learn about your country’s flag, what it represents, and how it fits into  your country’s history.</li>
<li>Understand what symbols are and the function they serve.</li>
<li>Learn how to brainstorm.</li>
<li>Practice discussing thoughts and ideas.</li>
<li>Find answers through discussion and research.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activity:</p>
<p>Examine the flag of your country.  What does it mean to you? How does
 it make you feel? Discuss why a country has a flag.  Record your ideas 
on your Sugar and if possible, post somewhere in the classroom.</p>
<p>Make a list of the symbols, pictures, colors and/or writing on your 
country’s flag. Discuss what the symbols stand for (for example, the 50 
stars on the American Flag represent the 50 states that are in the 
United States).  Add these ideas on your Sugar too.</p>
<p>In small groups, brainstorm (think together) about what these symbols
 mean. Why did the creators of the flag choose these symbols? What are 
some other symbols of your country? If you were designing the flag 
today, would symbols would you put on it?</p>
<p>As a class, share what each group discussed.  Explain the history of 
your native country’s flag and what the symbols actually mean. Share 
your ideas about other symbols of your country.</p>
<p>Create a picture of your country’s flag using “Paint” and save it.</p>

<div class="section" id="create-your-own-flag">
<h2>Create Your Own Flag<a class="headerlink" href="#create-your-own-flag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Skills:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Understand the purpose of a flag.</li>
<li>Reflect and think about individual characteristics.</li>
<li>Come up with symbols to represent these characteristics.</li>
<li>Practice presenting individual ideas to others.</li>

<p>Activity:</p>
<p>Using the “Paint” activity, design your own flag that symbolizes YOU.
 Place objects, symbols, colors and designs that are meaningful and 
representative of YOU. If you have difficulty coming up with ideas, talk
 to other students, they might help to spark ideas in your imagination.</p>
<p>Share your own personal flag with the class and explain the symbols 
you included on it. (For example, one girl’s flag might have many hearts
 because she has a lot of love for the people around her; another boy 
might have pictures of books because he love to read).</p>
<p>Put your newly created flag into the Slider Puzzle.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-n-puzzle-mathematical-patterns-and-sequences">
<h2>The n-puzzle (Mathematical Patterns and Sequences)<a class="headerlink" href="#the-n-puzzle-mathematical-patterns-and-sequences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The n-puzzle is general name for a slider puzzle that consists of a 
grid of numbered squares with one square missing, and the numbers out of
 sequence. The 9-puzzle is a 3×3 numbered grid, the 16 puzzle is a 4×4 
numbered grid. The goal of the n-puzzle is put the scrambled numbers 
back in sequence.</p>
<p>The n-puzzle is a classical problem for modeling repeatable steps (or
 “algorithms”) involving mathematical patterns (or “heuristics.”) For 
example, you can begin by counting the number of misplaced tiles as you 
formulate a strategy for solving the puzzle. The n-puzzle also helps 
students to understand that some tile arrangements are unsolvable.</p>
<p>Skills:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Recognize patterns.</li>
<li>Practice classification and grouping.</li>
<li>Practice sequencing.</li>
<li>Put numbers in order.</li>
</ul>
<p>Activity:</p>
<p>Start the Slider Puzzle activity click on the ‘select picture’ Button
 on the top and choose an image with numbers. Sequencing is when you put
 things into a logical order.</p>
<p>When the image comes up, think how this image is set up differently 
from the one on the Slider Puzzle.  The Slider Puzzle creates a large 
image, where all the squares are pieces of the larger image, while the 
Sequencing image contains a number on each tile.</p>
<p>Try to solve the 9-tile puzzle first. Try to put the numbers in order
 from smallest to largest.  Model for other students how to slide the 
keys and place them in order.</p>
<p>Once you are able to solve the 9-puzzle, share your strategies with 
the class. How is this different from the Slider Puzzles where you are 
assembling a picture?</p>
<p>Now try to solve the 16-puzzle. How is this harder or easier?</p>
<p>After completing the 16-puzzle, walk around and help those who are having trouble.</p>
