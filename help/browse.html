<p>The Browse activity is your means to explore a wider source of 
information and content that can be found in what’s called the World 
Wide Web (Internet or Web for short). Although there are some built-in 
information included on this activity (OLPC Library), to make the most 
of this activity you need an internet connection. Please see the chapter
 on “Neighborhood View and Connecting to the Internet”.</p>
<p>The first thing that you will see when you first click on the Browse icon from the Home View is what’s called the Home page.</p>

<p><strong>Browse Journal Entry Name</strong> - This will serve as the 
name of the Journal entry. Change this to something distinctive 
especially when you have multiple window tabs opened that’s related to 
one particular topic.</p>
<p><strong>Browse Description Bar</strong> - This will serve as the <strong>Browse</strong> activity description in the Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy Tool</strong> - Use this to change the privacy setting of the current Browse activity. The default is set to Private.</p>
<p><strong>Text Finder and Edit Tool</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Browse_text_and_edit_tool.png" src="Browse%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Browse_text_and_edit_tool.png">
<p><strong>Undo</strong> - The Browse activity remembers the last change
 that you’ve made on the page. Use this button to step back to the last 
change that you made.</p>
<p><strong>Redo</strong> - Use this button to go back to the current changes that you made after doing an “Undo”.</p>
<p><strong>Copy</strong> - This is used to copy a text or passage from 
the current page you are viewing. To do this, you need to first 
highlight (left-click while dragging your mouse arrow) the text. You 
know you’ve highlighted a text when its background color turned grey. 
Then, press this tool to copy it to the clipboard. A small image on the 
left hand side of the frame will appear. This “holds” the text you just 
copied. You can now “paste” this text or just simply click and drag it 
to other activities. The copied text will disappear once the XO is 
restarted or shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>Paste</strong> - This tool is for pasting texts from other 
activities into the current page that you are viewing. You can only 
paste texts on areas of the page where pasting is allowed. It will 
remember this text until the XO is restarted or shutdown.</p>
<p><strong>Text Search Bar</strong> -This tool is great to use when you 
need to quickly find a text on a current page you’re viewing. Press the 
enter key to go down the page. The text that you are looking for would 
be highlighted in green. Press the little “x” symbol on the right of the
 bar to erase the text.</p>
<p><strong>Text Search Navigation Arrows</strong> - While you can press 
the Enter key to search down the page, these arrows are useful to search
 the page. Use the left arrow to go back up the page and the right arrow
 to go down the page.</p>
<p><strong>View Tool</strong></p>
<img alt="_images/Browse_-_view_tool.png" src="Browse%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Browse_-_view_tool.png">
<p><strong>Zoom Out</strong> - When you want to see more of the page, use this tool to make it smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Zoom In</strong> - When you want to see things better, use this tool to make the page bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Full Screen</strong> - You can press this to see the entire page without the toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>Tray Toggle button</strong> - This tool only works when you 
have things on the tray (the space on the bottom of the Browse page) 
like pages that you have bookmarked (Please see bookmark description). 
Use this tool to make the tray visible or invisible. Browse remembers 
your bookmarked pages even when the tray is not visible. Just simply 
make it visible again to see those bookmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Home Icon</strong></p>
<p>Clicking this takes you back to the Home Page. Useful when you’re lost and need a starting point.</p>
<p><strong>Address Bar</strong></p>
<p>Each page on the internet has its own address. The address bar shows 
you the current web address of the page you are viewing. If you know the
 web address of a page, you can type it on this bar and press the enter 
key to navigate to that page.</p>
<p><strong>Bookmark</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to remember the pages that you visited. 
Clicking this icon will save the web address of the current page you are
 viewing. A small thumbnail image of this page will appear on the 
bottom(tray). Bookmarks are saved only on the current Browse activity. 
They will not show up when you open a new Browse activity.</p>
<p><strong>Stop Activity Tool</strong>
Closes the current Browse activity.</p>
<p><strong>OLPC Library</strong></p>
<p>The Browse activity has built in books, information and pages that 
you can access even without a connection to the internet. Click on any 
of the texts to see what you can find. Have fun exploring!</p>
<p>Copying Images From The Web</p>
<img alt="_images/Browse_-_copying_images.png" src="Browse%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Browse_-_copying_images.png">
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Every time you create something whether it’s a poem, a 
book or a nice picture, you own those works. The internet is filled with
 information and works that result from hard work and creativity of 
other people. Some owners of those work like to share them freely, but 
others don’t or require that you give them the credit. Sometimes this 
information can be found on the page you are viewing. When in doubt make
 sure to make a note in your documentation on where you found the 
information. A great page for further reading: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.copyrightkids.org/">http://www.copyrightkids.org/</a></p>
</div>
<p>To copy an image, point your mouse arrow on the picture and 
right-click on it (press the button on the bottom of your track pad that
 has a circle on it). A box similar to the picture shown above will 
appear with information on the source or web address of the picture 
along with the file name of the picture. There are two ways to copy an 
image:</p>
<p><strong>Keep Image</strong> - this will put a copy of the image to the Journal.</p>
<p><strong>Copy Image</strong> - this will place a copy of the image to 
the clipboard, which you can then drag and drop to another activity. 
This copy is temporary and will disappear from the clipboard when you 
shutdown the XO. So if you need to save the image, it is best to do a 
“Keep Image” instead.</p>

<h2>Learning with Browse<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-with-browse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Browse gives access to the internet which is a powerful information 
and communication tool and allows students to participate in the global 
community and experience. There are so many things on the web that you 
can use and incorporate in your classroom, but one of the many great 
ways to start is to help students make sense of where they are in 
relation to this global context. How far are they from the earthquake’s 
epicenter that rocked Japan? Where is their country’s capital? How big 
is their country compared to others? Where are the historical places in 
their country and the world that shaped human history and culture? One 
of the many great tools on the web that can be readily and freely 
accessed is Google maps (type this on the address bar): <a class="reference external" href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com/</a></p>
<img alt="_images/Browse_-_Google_Map.png" src="Browse%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Browse_-_Google_Map.png">
<p>If you live in an area that is adequately mapped by Google Maps, you 
can ask students to use the “Get directions” tool on the page to see how
 they can go from one place to another. The directions tool can also 
teach students a sense of distance by showing how far two places are 
from each other. Example, how far do they travel every day for school 
(Given that sense of distance, how far and how long will it take to get 
to the nearest city or town)?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extending-browse">
<h2>Extending Browse<a class="headerlink" href="#extending-browse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There’s a built in Google search bar on the home page of Browse that 
you can direct students to aid in their research. Help them narrow or 
expand their search texts to come up with better search results.</p>
<p>To allow students to be active participants in the global community, 
communication tools can be freely and readily accessed via Browse: from 
creating free e-mail accounts to tools that allow people to create their
 own internet sites and pages.</p>
<p>But like with any type of exploration, you have to start with 
caution. Not all information on the internet is good. Start with 
educating kids to safely use and explore the internet. You can check out
 sites like: <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wiredkids.org/kids/index.html">http://www.wiredkids.org/kids/index.html</a> for more information.</p>
