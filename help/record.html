<h2>About<a class="headerlink" href="#about" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Record Activity is used for recording audio and video and for 
taking pictures. You will need to have a built in, or an attached, 
microphone and/or camera to use Record.</p>
<p>If your computer has no built in camera, or an unsuitable camera attached, then Record, will open in <em>Record audio</em> mode only.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="quick-start">
<h2>Quick start<a class="headerlink" href="#quick-start" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are three record or capture modes. Select <strong>one</strong> of these buttons to chose your Record mode.</p>
<img alt="_images/Record0.png" src="Record%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Record0.png">
<p>The image above shows the buttons of the three <em>Record</em> modes, they are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Picture camera mode</li>
<li>Video camera mode</li>
<li>Audio, or sound mode</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This is the <em>Record</em> or capture button <img alt="Capture" src="Record%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/button.png"> in the centre of the screen, below <em>main image</em>.</p>
<p>The main image shows what will be captured. Record will capture whatever is in front of the camera in <em>Picture camera</em> mode, or <em>Video camera</em> mode, and will capture whatever the microphone can detect, when in <em>Audio</em> mode.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Tip</strong> As always in Sugar, if you are not sure what a button will do, hover the cursor over it, to reveal its function.</div></blockquote>

<p><strong>Toolbar and capture buttons explained</strong></p>
<p>The tool bar items are just as described above.</p>
<p>It is always a good idea to enter a name for your file <strong>1</strong> in the Activity tab, so that it is easier to find your work later.</p>
<p>If you have a camera, an image <strong>2</strong> appears in the 
picture window and looks like live video. As the audio file is saved, 
the image is saved as a snapshot to help identify your audio recording.</p>
<p>The Select timer and Timer duration buttons <strong>3</strong> are 
available, to set a delay before start of recording, and set the 
duration. You can either leave the audio recording to run for the set 
duration, or press the stop capture button <strong>4</strong> at any time.</p>
<p>As with the photo and video modes, you see an icon for your recording <strong>5</strong> show up in the tray once you are done.</p>

name, and inspect an image once it has been taken. This sequence is 
taken in <em>Picture camera</em> mode, but the features are similar in all modes.</p>
<img alt="_images/Record1composite.png" src="Record%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Record1composite.png">
<p>The first screen shot, top left, shows the main image in Picture 
camera mode, while a picture, just taken, has been automatically saved 
and named in the Journal. It shows up as a thumbnail on the tray. The 
cursor is hovering on the thumbnail. The automaticly given, temporary 
name, is “Photo by Sugar Learner” <strong>1</strong>.</p>
<p>When we click the thumbnail, the main image changes to <em>viewer</em> mode. Images are viewed and information can be updated.</p>
<p>A field, in which to enter a title for the photo appears <strong>2</strong>. The title “Cornish village” is entered. Also at this point <strong>2</strong> is the full screen mode button. This will switch the main image to full screen.</p>
<p>At the bottom right of the main image is a little tab, <strong>3</strong>, which allows you to find out more about the photo that was taken. Now pressing that tab <strong>4</strong> reveals the image information, author, date, and a space to add tags. A tag is a single word that helps categorize an item.</p>
<p>The tray displays a history of your previously taken photos. When you have more photos in the tray the <em>scroll button</em> <strong>5</strong> scrolls through the images.</p>
<p>To replay a video or audio recording, click the thumbnail of the 
recording in the tray. When viewing or listening to a clip, if you move 
your cursor in the main image area, you see small window <strong>6</strong>, representing the output of your camera or microphone. Click on that window to return from <em>viewer</em> mode to <em>capture</em> mode.</p>
<p>The final image is displayed full screen, and can be reduced to normal with the button <strong>7</strong>.</p>
<p>Record stores images and audio in the Journal, from which they can be
 used by other activities, such as Paint, Write, Etoys, and Browse, as 
well as Memorize and some other games. Images can be copied to a USB 
storage device from the Journal.</p>

<p>Once you have made your Activity available to share, others, looking 
at their Neighborhood View, see your icon with the Record icon, an eye, 
close to it. They can now join your Activity by clicking on the Record

<p>They must then select “Join” and their Record Activity opens with your images in their tray.</p>
<p>Now in Record, thumbnails of both parties are shared. The frame of

<h2>Things to Try with Record<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-try-with-record" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can easily take pictures and make videos by using a built-in, or 
connected, camera for still photography and video recording. You can 
also use the camera for video conferencing, which involves talking to 
others on a video screen knowing that the others can also view your 
video.</p>
<p>You can express yourself with sound, images, and video using the 
cameras and microphones. You are learning about light, observations, 
angle, and perspective. By recording the sights and sounds around you, 
others can learn about you, your culture, and environment. You can 
communicate with your voice and pictures. You can tell factual or 
emotional stories with film or pictures to help change perceptions or 
take action.</p>
<p>You could also try some of the following :</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Use the Record Activity to record your voice with a built-in microphone.</li>
<li>Take a photo of where you live by aiming the camera lens at your home, and then clicking the circle icon.</li>
<li>Record sounds of your city or town.</li>
<li>Record and leave messages for your family.</li>
<li>Teachers - record a message for parents.</li>
<li>Interview your friends and record it to audio or video.</li>
<li>Make a video diary.</li>
<li>Open your photos in the Paint Activity and draw on them.</li>
<li>Add your pictures to a story using Write.</li>
<li>Upload a picture to Flickr or Wikimedia Commons.</li>
<li>Attach a picture to an e-mail you send to a friend or family member.</li>
<li>Take a picture of a flower or plant from the same place every day to show how it changes.</li>
<li>Take a picture of a baby animal every week to show how it grows.</li>
</ul>
