<h2>Learning with Clock<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-with-clock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At a basic level, Clock allows you to learn how to tell time, which 
is a very important cognitive skill.
Learning to tell time can be very useful for you in your daily life- you
 are able to know when you should wake up in time for school, when it is
 time for meals or allowing you to keep a timetable.</p>
<div class="section" id="learning-to-count-time">
<h3>Learning to Count Time<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-to-count-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The idea for having an analog display gives you a platform to learn 
counting as well. Given that a clock has distinguishing numbers from one
 to twelve and has five marks in between, you are able to know how to 
count by five when from “five-ten-fifteen-twenty” until you get to 
“sixty”.</p>

<div class="section" id="reading-time-in-different-ways">
<h3>Reading Time in Different Ways<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-time-in-different-ways" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You are able read the time in both the analog display and the digital
 display.
Using the digital display, you are able to understand that time is 
displayed in the Hour:Minute:Second format. Moreover, with the option of
 having a 12-hour clock or a 24-hour clock, you are able to explore the 
concept of AM and PM, midnight, or afternoon, which gives a broader 
classification of time.
Using the analog display, you are not only able to count time as well, 
you are able to visualize the idea of a 12-hour clock, where the clock 
makes 2 complete cycles in 24-hours. Jennie Ito, a PhD holder in Child 
Development, mentioned that analog clocks help children understand the 
passage of time because they have hands that are consistently moving. 
This idea was perfectly encapsulated in a ticking clock feature in 
Clock.
Not only that, you can learn how to tell time in terms of day and date, 
which helps you understand what is meant by months and days.</p>

<div class="section" id="speaking-time">
<h3>Speaking Time<a class="headerlink" href="#speaking-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In an analog clock, the clock is divided into 12 sections and the 
hands move in a clockwise direction. The smaller hand gives the hour- 
for example, if the hour hand is pointing at 3, then it is currently 3 
o’clock. In this case, the minute hand will be at 12, because it has 
made a complete cycle.
If the minute hand is pointing to the clock number 1, you would say 5 
minutes and this done by counting by 5s around the clock. However, if 
the minute hand is in between two clock numbers, you have to count by 5s
 until you get to the nearest clock number, and then count up by ones to
 figure out how many minutes you have.</p>
<p>In the digital clock, you can divide the display into three sections, the hour, minute and seconds.</p>
<p>The speaking time is given by the speaking mode, which tells time in ‘o’clock’, ‘three forty-five PM’ or ‘midnight’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-about-angles">
<h3>Learning about Angles<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-about-angles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Angles are an important concept that can be learnt through Clock, 
especially since the hour and minute hand can be dragged.
The hour hand of an analog clock turns 360° in 12 hours or 0.5° per 
minute. The minute hand rotates through 360° in 60 minutes or 6° per 
minute.</p>

<h3>Finding the Geographical North or South<a class="headerlink" href="#finding-the-geographical-north-or-south" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With the concept of telling time, you can find an analog watch and explore the concept of true North.</p>
<p>In the Northern Hemisphere...</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Place the watch on a level surface, such as the ground, or hold it horizontal in your hand</li>
<li>Point the hour hand at the sun</li>
<li>Find the angle between the hour hand and the twelve o’ clock mark on the watch to find the north-south line</li>
</ol>
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere...</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Place the watch on a level surface, such as the ground, or hold it horizontal in your hand</li>
<li>Point the hour hand at the sun</li>
<li>Find the angle between the hour hand and the twelve o’ clock mark on the watch to find the north-south line</li>
</ol>
<p>The centre of the angle between the hour hand and twelve o’clock mark
 is the north-south line. If you don’t know which way is north and which
 south, just remember that no matter where you are, the sun rises in the
 east and sets in the west. In the northern hemisphere the sun is due 
south at midday. If your watch is set to daylight saving time bisect the
 angle between the hour hand and the one o’clock mark instead.</p>

<div class="section" id="grabbing-hands">
<h3>Grabbing Hands<a class="headerlink" href="#grabbing-hands" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Many times, you would want to use the clock as a form of 
visualization- it represents a circle, it represents one point of 360°, 
it represents pi. There are so much that you can do with clock, and that
 is why, the grabbing hands feature was added. Instead of simply using 
the clock to learn about time, you can adjust the hour, minute and 
second hand in order to test your concept of the representing time, or 
to show the angles. Moreover, using the grabbing hands feature gives you
 the empowerment of controlling your own time, and teaches you the 
concept of time management.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ticking-clock">
<h3>Ticking Clock<a class="headerlink" href="#ticking-clock" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Time passes really quickly, and that is why the ticking clock feature
 exists in order to provide an audio indication of the seconds that have
 past. You could use this feature as a metronome, which is a device used
 by musicians that marks time at a selected rate by giving a regular 
tick. If you are practising music or would just like to beat to a 
rhyhtm, it is useful for you to count on the ticking clock feature!</p>
