<p>The Chat Activity is used to exchange messages with your friends or 
classmates. You can chat about a topic you are studying or you can share
 something private that happened in your life. You need at least two 
active XOs to chat - your own and the one that your friend uses.</p>

<h3>Sharing Chat<a class="headerlink" href="#sharing-chat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

  and hold the pointer on their icon until the “Invite to” popup 
appears.  Now a Chat icon appears in the menu and the friend gets an 
invitation to Chat in their frame. Your Chat icon also appears in their 
Neighborhood view.</p>

<h2>Join a Chat<a class="headerlink" href="#join-a-chat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can join a Sugar Chat that has already been started.</p>
<p>Two or more XO computers from One Laptop Per Child can speak to each 
other directly without an Internet connection. This is a direct 
connection. You can also chat with people on the Internet who use Sugar.
 This section describes joining a chat between two or more XO computers 
from One Laptop Per Child.</p>
<p>First, look at the Neighborhood View to see if there is an existing Chat you want to join.</p>
<p><strong>CHAT SAFELY</strong>: Only chat with someone you know. If a someone invites you to chat, don’t chat with them unless you know them.</p>
<img alt="_images/Sugar-share-chat_invite_5-en.png" src="Chat%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Sugar-share-chat_invite_5-en.png">
<p>If you see a XO icon with a little speech bubble icon next to it, 
that person is in a shared Chat. Several people may be around the Chat 
icon, showing a group Chat.</p>

<p>Click the little speech icon, and select the Join option.</p>
<p>Then the Chat Activity starts, connected to the shared Chat. You see the other people in the Chat, on the Frame.</p>
<div class="section" id="chatting">
<h3>Chatting<a class="headerlink" href="#chatting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<h2>Things to Do with Chat<a class="headerlink" href="#things-to-do-with-chat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Chat is a great for sending messages back and forth with a friend, socializing, and working together on projects.</p>
<p>Remember that being polite on a computer is just as important as being polite when you’re speaking with someone.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Be polite. Try not to interrupt.</li>
<li>Read through what people are saying before you say something.</li>
<li>Don’t type in ALL CAPITAL LETTERS. This style is considered rude as it is like shouting at someone.</li>
<li>If you do not speak the same language as another person it may be 
difficult to communicate with Chat. Be patient. If you have an Internet 
connection, you can try going to www.google.com/translate and type in a 
phrase that you want to say in another language so you can be friendly 
online.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fun</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It can be fun to make words shorter when typing in a Chat Activity 
because it is faster, like texting (sending messages) on a mobile phone.
 For example instead of typing in “how are you?”, you can type in “how r
 u?”</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<div>The following are some ways you might like to try using Chat:</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Arrange a time to meet friends to play.</li>
<li>Organize a community gathering.</li>
<li>Bring friends together to talk about doing a group project.</li>
<li>Brainstorm ideas (either “fast and furious” or by taking turns).</li>
<li>Ask your teacher questions about your homework.</li>
<li>Use Chat and write a story with friends online using the Write Activity.</li>
<li>Use Chat to practice writing in a foreign language (see if you can find a native speaker to chat with).</li>
<li>Organize other Sugar or XO users to meet and learn from each other.</li>
<li>Use Chat to communicate with a grandparent or other family member.</li>
<li>Interview an expert using the Chat Activity as if they were in the 
classroom, especially an expert who wouldn’t otherwise be able to visit.</li>
<li>Take group discussion notes.</li>
<li>Play a word-association game such as typing the first word that comes to mind when your friend types red.</li>
<li>Play a role-playing game (for example, have a friend pretend to be a
 character from a book you are reading, and chat with the role-playing 
friend).</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="use-emoticons-in-chat">
<h3>Use emoticons in Chat<a class="headerlink" href="#use-emoticons-in-chat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are ways to tell friends how you feel just by using letters - 
they can let someone know if you are happy, sad, or having fun. When you
 make letters look like a face, they are called emoticons.</p>
<p>Some are written so that you read them sideways.</p>
<p>This is a happy face:</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>This is a sad face:</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>This is a wink:</p>
<p>;)</p>
<p>See if you can find the keys on the keyboard to make the faces</p>
<p>The two dots are the colon key : and the semicolon key ;</p>
<p>The mouth are the parentheses keys ()</p>
<p>You can also make faces that go across:</p>
<p>Happy</p>
<p>(^_^)</p>
<p>Sad</p>
<p>(&lt;_&gt;)</p>
<p>Winking (^_~)</p>
<p>What other emoticons can you create with text in the Chat Activity?</p>
<p>Can you draw pictures using only the text symbols on your keyboard? 
This combination of a symbol and a number looks like a sideways heart 
&lt;3. “I &lt;3 my XO” means, “I love my XO.”</p>

<div class="section" id="make-friends">
<h3>Make Friends<a class="headerlink" href="#make-friends" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you are in the Neighborhood View, if you move the pointer over 
someone, you can see their name, and click Make Friends. When you Make 
Friends, your new friend appears in your Group View list.</p>
<p>The Group View list helps you keep a list of your friends online who you like chatting with.</p>

<div class="section" id="notes-for-parents-and-teachers">
<h3>Notes for parents and teachers<a class="headerlink" href="#notes-for-parents-and-teachers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Chat presents a great opportunity engage children in reading and 
writing. The natural inclination for children to socialize and express 
themselves can be channeled in some of the exercises outlined above. 
(Some children who are by their nature shy and reserved, are more 
confident speaking up in a chat room.) Chat can be motivating and is an 
authentic use of language skills, however, preparation and supervision 
are recommended.</p>
<p>Prepare your children and students:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Remind them never to chat with someone they don’t know.</li>
<li>Remind them to be courteous and never to use language they wouldn’t 
be comfortable with in their oral communication (for example, it’s OK to
 disagree, but not to be disagreeable).</li>
</ul>
<p>Prepare your chat session:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Some teachers prepare questions in advance. They can paste these 
questions into the Chat session from the Clipboard or Write 
Activity—this helps them stay on task and keeps the pace of the session 
lively.</li>
<li>Limit the number of students participating in the Chat session; more that 10–12 participants makes a session chaotic.</li>
<li>Ask your students to prepare by posing questions in advance.</li>
<li>As in any classroom discussion, keep the conversation focused on just one or two topics.</li>
<li>IT IS SOMETIME USEFUL TO USE ALL-CAPS TO GET EVERYONE’S ATTENTION.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Advanced features<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Computers not running Sugar can initiate chat connections to a Sugar 
user by running a Jabber (XMPP) client, either with both computers 
registered on the same Jabber server or by running a link local XMPP 
account such as Empathy with salut or Pidgin with Bonjour.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a buddy list on another non-Sugar computer.</p>
<img alt="_images/Sugar-share-chat2-en.png" src="Chat%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/Sugar-share-chat2-en.png">
<p>When you initiating the chat on a non-Sugar computer using a Jabber 
client, an invitation appears on the Sugar computer and the Sugar user 
can chat with you as usual except that the colors of the non-Sugar 
participant’s response lines are gray as shown below.</p>

<p>CHAT SAFELY: Remember, only chat with someone you know. If someone 
invites you to chat, don’t chat with them unless you know them. It’s 
perfectly okay to refuse a chat request.</p>
