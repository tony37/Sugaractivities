<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cartoon Builder lets you explore the cartoon-making process called 
“cell-animation” which uses a sequence of pictures with small 
differences to create the illusion of movement.</p>
<p>You can create your own cartoon by placing different pictures of a 
cartoon character inside the squares (“cells”) of a filmstrip, adding 
different backgrounds and sound effects, and playing the pictures back 
in order like a little movie. You can save your cartoon on the Sugar, 
and share it with friends and family.</p>
<p>Cartoon Builder helps you explore how cartoons are created, and learn how to put creative ideas into action.</p>
<p>Creating a story with pictures can also help you to express ideas that you may not yet have words for.</p>
<p>In the process of creating and sharing your cartoons, you will also 
learn how to use many Sugar activities, including Paint, Camera, and 
Microphone.</p>
<p>Throughout the school year, the Cartoon Builder can be integrated 
into different subject areas (example: creative writing, art and drama).
  You can make Cartoon Builder images that relate to a subject the class
 is studying, and share them with peers.</p>

<h2>Explore Animation with Cartoon Builder<a class="headerlink" href="#explore-animation-with-cartoon-builder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Do you like cartoons? Who are some of your favorite cartoon characters?</p>
<p>A cartoon is made from a series of drawing with small differences 
that, when viewed quickly, seem to move. This movement is called 
animation.
Try the Cartoon Builder to learn more about how animation works.</p>
<p>Open the MaMaMedia Activity Center from the Sugar Home screen.</p>
<p>Open the Cartoon Builder from the MaMaMedia Activity Center.</p>
<p>A space alien will appear in the activity. You can play with this 
character, or choose a different one using the Character chooser on the 
right. Click on the arrows to see more characters.</p>
<p>After you choose a character, decide which 6 movements you would like your character to make.</p>
<p>Click on the first box in the filmstrip at the top of the screen, and
 then click on an image in the pose gallery on the left. The image you 
chose will appear in the first box. Repeat this process for all six 
boxes.</p>
<p>Press the Play arrow under the big picture to make your cartoon go.</p>
<p>Explore the backgrounds and sounds on the right of the screen.  Click
 on the arrows to see more backgrounds and hear different sounds.</p>
<p>Save your animation when you are happy with it. Click the “Save” 
(computer disc) button in the top right corner of the screen. Give it a 
name you will remember, like “Cartoon1” and click “Save.”</p>
<p>To find “Cartoon1” later, click on the “Open” (folder) button in the 
top right corner (next to “Save”). Click “Cartoon1” on the list that 
appears to load your animation in the Cartoon Builder.</p>
<p>Share your cartoons with classmates, and look at the cartoons they 
made.  Talk about making the cartoons. What was hard? What was fun? What
 did you learn?</p>
<p>Record the ideas your class had using the “Write” activity on your 
Sugar.  If you have poster paper, you can create a set of ‘Cartoon 
Making tips’ to put up on the wall.</p>

<h2>Make a Spinning Thaumatrope<a class="headerlink" href="#make-a-spinning-thaumatrope" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Animation is an illusion that happens when you look at two or more pictures and they seem to blend into one moving image.</p>
<p>A thaumatrope is a piece of paper with two pictures, one on each 
side. If you have access to paper or note cards, tape and a pencil, a 
thaumatrope is fun and helpful tool for understanding how pictures 
appear to become animated.</p>
<p>Materials
Index card (cut in half)
Pencil, crayon or marker to draw with
Stick to tape cards on (pencil is OK too)
Tape, glue or something to stick paper to the pencil or stick.</p>
<p>Instructions:</p>
<p>Think of the animation that you want to make. For example, a fish in a bowl or a cat in a tree.</p>
<p>Draw one part of the picture on one half of the card (example: fish) 
and draw the second part of the picture (example: the fish bowl) on the 
second half.</p>
<p>Tape the pencil or stick to the back of one card and then tape the 
second card to the pencil so that the drawings are back-to-back.</p>
<p>Spin the thaumatrope by rolling the pencil between your hands.  What do you see?</p>

<div class="section" id="create-dancing-pictures">
<h2>Create “Dancing Pictures”<a class="headerlink" href="#create-dancing-pictures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Cartoons are like dancing pictures.  When you dance, you move your 
body through a set of poses. Each pose is a little bit different from 
the one before it.  When you make a cartoon, you draw a set of picture 
poses where each one is just a little bit different than the one before 
it.  Flipping through all the pictures quickly creates the illusion of 
movement.</p>
<p>Materials
6 index cards (or one piece of paper cut into 6 pieces)
Pencil, crayon or marker</p>
<p>Instructions:
Think of a dance (or an exercise or a silly movement) with six poses.</p>
<p>Slowly demonstrate the poses of that dance for your class. Then do 
the dance faster. (If you prefer, you could ask a volunteer from the 
class to demonstrate the dance.)</p>
<p>Invite the whole class to get up and try the dance. Remind them to think about each of the poses as they dance.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of dancing, ask everyone sit back down.</p>
<p>Now take out a pencil and six index cards.</p>
<p>Draw a stick figure doing each pose on separate index cards.</p>
<p>Act out each pose to help other students draw.</p>
<p>Put your 6 cards into a stack and either staple it or hold it tightly by the upper left corner.</p>
<p>You can make the cartoon stick figure “dance”, by holding the book on
 the stapled edge with you left hand and flipping the lower left corner 
of the stack with your right thumb.</p>
<p>Flipping the images trick your eye! It seems like the stick person 
dances, but it is an illusion caused by looking at the pictures quickly.</p>
<p>Customize your cartoon flipbooks further by coloring them or adding more poses.</p>
<p>Alternative to dancing:
Try acting out the movements of a non-human character, like a frog 
hopping. Perform these movements for your class and have them guess who 
your character might be.</p>

<div class="section" id="add-your-own-backgrounds-to-cartoon-builder">
<h2>Add Your Own Backgrounds to Cartoon Builder<a class="headerlink" href="#add-your-own-backgrounds-to-cartoon-builder" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Use the Paint or Camera activity on your Sugar to make your own original background images for your cartoon.</p>
<p>Make a background picture with Paint:
Open the Paint or Camera activity from the Home screen of your Sugar.</p>
<p>With Paint, draw a scene (place where the character can be) such as a school room or a field or the edge of a river.</p>
<p>With Camera, take a photo of a place, such as school or your house.</p>
<p>Save the picture with a name you will remember like “background1”</p>
<p>Add your background to the Cartoon Builder:
From the Home screen of your Sugar, click on the Mama Media icon.</p>
<p>Open the Cartoon Builder activity from the MaMaMedia Activity Center.</p>
<p>Click on the “My Background” button and find your picture called 
“background1” in the list of files that appears.  Click on it and then 
click the “Open” button.</p>
<p>Your “background1” picture will load into the Cartoon Builder</p>
<p>Choose a character and place it in your background. Add sound and save it.</p>
<p>Show it to your friends and classmates, and tell them how you did it Help others to create their own background pictures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="draw-and-animate-your-own-character">
<h2>Draw and Animate Your Own Character<a class="headerlink" href="#draw-and-animate-your-own-character" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can use Paint to make your own original cartoon character in lots
 of poses. Then you can use the “My Own” functionality in the Cartoon 
Builder to import the poses and create original cartoons.  Learn the 
steps by creating a simple cartoon face.</p>
<p>First create four face pictures using Paint on your Sugar:</p>
<p>Open the Paint activity from the Home screen of your Sugar.</p>
<p>Use the Paint tools to draw a face with eyes, nose, ears and hair.  Do not draw a mouth yet.</p>
<p>Click “Save Image” button</p>
<p>When the Save window appears, click on the button “New folder” and 
type “Face” into the folder name field. Click the “Create” button.</p>
<p>A new folder called “Face” will appear in the list of places where you can save your picture. Double click on “Face” to open it.</p>
<p>Save the picture here with the name “Face1” and click OK.</p>
<p>Now draw a frowning mouth on the face and save it as “Face 2”</p>
<p>Erase the frown and draw a straight line mouth. Save it as “Face 3”</p>
<p>Erase the straight line mouth and draw a smile. Save it as “Face 4”</p>
<p>Now put your pictures into the Cartoon Builder and animate the face:</p>
<p>From the Home screen of your Sugar, click on the MaMaMedia icon.</p>
<p>Open the Cartoon Builder from the MaMaMedia Activity Center.</p>
<p>Click the “My Character” button, find the “Face” folder and open it.</p>
<p>The three facial images you created will appear in the poses list on the left side of your screen.</p>
<p>Place them in box 1, 2, and 3 in the slides on top of your screen, and then press Play to see the face animate.</p>
<p>Save this cartoon and share it with your class.</p>
<p>Discuss what you were able to do with your images.  Did you learn anything new about animation?</p>
<p>Open the “Write” activity on your Sugar and write down the ideas from your discussion.</p>
<p>NOTE:  Drawings you make with Paint only have one layer, so your 
character will completely cover the backgrounds offered in Cartoon 
Builder.  Try drawing a background around your character in Paint.</p>
