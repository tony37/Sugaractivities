<h2>About<a class="headerlink" href="#about" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The FotoToon Activity will allow you to create everything from a 
simple “comic” strip to a long elaborate illustrated document. You will 
be able to import many kinds of images into the panes of your project 
and add text bubbles to help tell the story. You can use photo images 
taken with the XO or imported from a camera, drawings made with 
Activities such as Paint, and images of all kinds downloaded from the 
web. This could include photos, charts and graphs, maps, and the like.</p>
<p>This introduction to FotoToon will show you how to get started with a simple 4 panel project.</p>
<p>FotoToon, like many other Sugar Activities, is often updated to fix 
“bugs” that users report. There was one update, from version 15 to 
version 16 during the time this instruction chapter was written. By the 
time you use it, there may be others. The changes are usually minor and 
should not interfere with the usefulness of this information. Always try
 to be sure you are using the latest version.</p>

<p>The FotoToon Toolbar has 9 icons including 3 with pulldown menus. The
 main FotoToon toolbar allows you to access many features of the 
Activity. Here is a description of what each of the icons will allow you
 to do:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The FotoToon icon. When you hover your cursor over this icon you 
will open a small pulldown that allows you to export your work as an 
image or a book  (pdf file). See below for more details.</li>
<li>This icon allows you to view the content in full screen or presentation mode.</li>
<li>The <strong>Add Photo</strong> icon. This icon allows you to add an 
image to your project. It can be a photo you take with the XO or digital
 camera, or import from the web. It can also be a picture, page, or 
project you create in another Sugar Activity.</li>
<li>The <strong>Add a globe</strong> icon. This allows you to add a 
globe. It is used to tell what the characters of your image is speaking.
 This also include some other icons such as whispher and think.</li>
<li>The <strong>Choose a movement line</strong> icon. This can be used to insert some other icons such as highlight and idea to the image.</li>
<li>The <strong>Rotate</strong> icon. This allows you to rotate the selected object in the clockwise direction in 90 degrees for each click.</li>
<li>The <strong>Delete</strong> icon. This allows you to delete the selected object.</li>
<li>This icon allows you to change the text properties of what you have typed. See below for more details.</li>
<li>The familiar stop-sign icon is one way to stop the FotoToon Activity. You can also use the keyboard shortcut: ctrl-Q.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> box allows you to give a name to your project. Click on it and replace the content with the name you wish for your work.</p>

<p>1a- This little panel allows you to name your project before you 
export it as an image. If you do nothing, it will appear in the Journal 
as, “FotoToon as image.” If you give it a name, such as “My Project-1” 
before exporting it will appear in the Journal as “My Project-1 as 
image”. This will make it easier to find later in the Journal. Just 
erase the FotoToon label and replace it with the title you want to use. 
If you forget to name it when saving, you can always go to the Journal 
and select and rename it.</p>
<p>1b- This allows you to add a description to the journal entry.</p>
<p>1c- This greyed out icon for home view is currently inactive.</p>
<p>1d- Click on this icon to export your project as an image. The export
 will just show your project. The tool bars and other things on the 
screen will not be included. If you wish a screen shot of the entire 
screen, you can make one by using the usual alt-1 (press the alt key and
 the 1 key at the same time).</p>
<p>1e- Click this icon to export your project as an book. The export 
will just show your project. The tool bars and other things on the 
screen will not be included. The book will be saved in PDF format. It

<h2>Learning with FotoToon<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-with-fototoon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="plan-ahead">
<h3>Plan Ahead<a class="headerlink" href="#plan-ahead" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>FotoToon can be used for a wide variety of learning activities, but 
the general process is always similar. For the sample project in this 
section, we will make a 4 panel page using 4 photos. This is a good way 
to get started since the page can be printed on a single page.</p>
<p>Here are the general steps you need to complete before you build your first FotoToon project:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Step One: Decide what your project will be about.</strong> 
You can tell a story about anything. For example, it could be about your
 pets, your home, your family, your town, or, even some photos you took 
at a party. Any topic is fine for our first project. The sample project 
will be about “Healthy Snacks” and the photos will be pictures of food.</li>
<li><strong>Step Two: Make a plan.</strong> Before you begin you should 
make a plan that will guide you through the construction of your 
project. Some people like to draw a little sketch of each pane showing 
what will be in the picture and a suggestion for what words will be 
added. If you like the panes can each be on a separate small piece of 
paper so you can re-arrange them easily This is called a <strong>Story Board</strong>.
 You may have another way you would like to make your plan, just be sure
 to include information about what pictures you will use, where you will
 get them, and what text you plan to add.</li>
<li><strong>Step Three: Gather your images.</strong> For starters, we will use images that were taken either with a camera, or using the <strong>Record Activity</strong> on the XO. Any image that can be imported to the Journal on your XO and viewed in <strong>Image Viewer</strong>
 can be used. It is a good idea to rename each of the photos you will be
 using in the Journal. The name can include the number of the pane you 
plan to use it in so it is easy to find when you begin putting things 
together.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="place-your-images">
<h3>Place Your Images<a class="headerlink" href="#place-your-images" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Open the Journal and check to be sure your images are there and can 
be viewed in the Image Viewer (click on the file to open it and check). 
Be sure the images have names that include the number of the pane you 
plan to place them (1,2,3, or 4).</li>
<li>Open FotoToon and find the “Add Photo” icon (number 3 in the 
FotoToon main toolbar shown above). A list of available images will 
appear. Click on the one you want to put in the first pane. When it has 
loaded, you can either leave it or remove it with the minus sign icon 
(number 7 in the main toolbar shown above). Warning: You can only remove
 the last image entered. That is why it is important to number the 
images according to the panes you wish to place them in. After the first
 image has been placed, continue adding images until all four for your 
first project have been placed. If you decide later that you want to 
change their order after they have been placed, you will need to delete 
them and replace them in the new order. It is best to get your final 
placement before adding any text.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/FotoToon_FotoToon.png" src="FotoToon%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/FotoToon_FotoToon.png">
<p>If you would like to use the same images that will be used in this 
sample project, you will find them at these links. Go to each link, 
upload the photo to a usb drive, plug it into your XO, and open by 
clicking on the image names. They will open in the Image Viewer and be 
automatically saved so you can access them for your project.</p>

<div class="section" id="add-dialog-and-titles">
<h2>Add Dialog and Titles<a class="headerlink" href="#add-dialog-and-titles" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you have planned well with your storyboard, you will have a pretty
 good idea of what you want to put in your dialog balloons and text 
boxes. You may even have a title in mind for your project. You can 
actually start this process anywhere in your project. All of the 
balloons and boxes you will be using to do this will be identified in 
the first image above, the The Main PhotoToonToolbar.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Making and placing your Title: If you know what you would like your 
title to be, you can start with that. It can always be changed later. 
When you start a project in FotoToon there will already be a tiny box 
for the title in a narrow band across the top of the project window. You
 can drag the upper left corner of the box to enlarge it (look for the 
cursor arrow to change to a thinner double headed arrow). You can also 
move it around in the band across the top. Click on the box and type all
 or part of your title. Then you can change the type style and size 
using the pull downs in the Text Pulldown menu (see 8d and 8e) in the 
picture above). Experiment until you find a style and size you like. You
 can also change the color of the type. Don’t worry if it isn’t perfect,
 you can always come back later and change it. Notice that you can erase
 part of the text by backspacing over it.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/FotoToon_Captura2.png" src="FotoToon%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/FotoToon_Captura2.png">
<p>In this image you can see that we selected bold, a red color from the
 color palette, a type size of 26, and the Font “Monospace”.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Adding Text Balloons: You can place the text balloons wherever you 
like within a pane. Click on the pane, then on the balloon you want to 
use (see “Add a global menu” and “Choose a movement line menu” above for
 explanations). The balloon will appear in the pane. You can drag it to 
the position where you want it, and also can drag the little tail to 
point to the source of the dialog. Add the words to the balloon in the 
same way you added them to the Title box.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/FotoToon_Captura3.png" src="FotoToon%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/FotoToon_Captura3.png">
<p>In this image you can see that we have added 4 dialog balloons (#4 in
 the main toolbar). We could also have used the “think” balloon, or the 
“whisper” balloon. The first pane is OK, but the first balloon in the 
second pane needs to be dragged to a better shape and size. The second 
balloon in the second pane appears just as it does when it is first 
added. It still needs to have text added and to be resized (by dragging a
 corner). You can see that our type size is 10, text color is black, and
 we are still using the “Monospace” font.</p>
<p>As you work with the various text items, you may wish to eliminate 
one entirely. Just click on it, then on the icon with the minus (-) sign
 (#7 in the main toolbar), and it will disappear.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Adding Exclamation Balloons: You may wish to include special 
exclamations to your project. Choose the exclamation balloon (choose 
from # 4 in the main toolbar). It is possible to eliminate the one 
longer point on the balloon by dragging it so that it matched the 
others. Again, type into the balloon just as you did in the title box 
and dialog balloons.</li>
<li>Adding extra Text Boxes: You can add a text box anywhere in any pane
 by clicking on the pane and then on the box icon in the diagram (choose
 from #4 in the main toolbar).</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/Exclamations&amp;Boxes.png" src="FotoToon%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/ExclamationsBoxes.png">
<p>In this example you can see we have added 4 exclamation balloons and 
one extra text box. We used the same text size, font, and color as in 
the rest of the project. You could choose to use different ones in your 
project.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="exporting-your-project">
<h2>Exporting Your Project<a class="headerlink" href="#exporting-your-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now, if you have followed the instructions above, you should have a 
small, completed FotoToon Project. You may have decided to use the same 
photos that are in the sample, or you may have chosen to use images you 
have imported. These can be from your camera, your XO, downloads from 
the web, projects you have made in other Activities, drawings you made 
in Paint, or even photos you have modified in Paint (import, then add 
things and/or crop as you like). When finished, your project will look 
something like this:</p>
<img alt="_images/FotoToonFoodFinalSm.png" src="FotoToon%20%E2%80%94%20Sugar%200.106%20documentation_files/FotoToonFoodFinalSm.png">
<p>Regardless of what you have made for your project, you will probably 
want to share it with others. You can do this as an email attachment or 
print it out as a paper copy. To do this, you need to export your 
project as an image stored in your Journal. The instructions for 
exporting your project are shown above. We will repeat them here as 
well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>The Export Pulldown<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<p>1a- This little panel allows you to name your project before you 
export it as an image. If you do nothing, it will appear in the Journal 
as, “FotoToon as image.” If you give it a name, such as “My Project-1” 
before exporting it will appear in the Journal as “My Project-1 as 
image”. This will make it easier to find later in the Journal. Just 
erase the FotoToon label and replace it with the title you want to use. 
If you forget to name it when saving, you can always go to the Journal 
and select and rename it.</p>
<p>1b- This allows you to add a description to jounal entry.</p>
<p>1c- This greyed out icon for home view is currently inactive.</p>
<p>1d- Click on this icon to export your project as an image. The export
 will just show your project. The tool bars and other things on the 
screen will not be included. If you wish a screen shot of the entire 
screen, you can make one by using the usual alt-1 (press the alt key and
 the 1 key at the same time).</p>
<p>1e- Click this icon to export your project as an book. The export 
will just show your project. The tool bars and other things on the 
screen will not be included. The book will be saved in PDF format. It 
can be viewed from Read Activity.</p>
<p>Look in the Journal. Your project should appear there with the name 
you gave it before exporting. If you forgot to give it a name, it will 
just say “FotoToon.” If this happened, rename it now, in the Journal 
before you forget to do it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extending-fototoon">
<h2>Extending FotoToon<a class="headerlink" href="#extending-fototoon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FotoToon can be used for much more than the simple 4-pane example we 
built in the instructions. It can be adapted for use in many different 
subject areas where students and teachers can construct lessons on any 
topic. Here are some possible ideas for projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Student written comic books for language arts 
practice. Students can write their own little “graphic novels” and even 
print them and take home to share with friends and family.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Student produced magazine articles for any topic 
they and their teachers choose. A single page or two-page “spread” will 
make it like the ones you see in actual magazines. One or more panes on 
the page can be used just for text to extend the story. The text could 
be written in another program and imported as an image or put in a large
 text box that fills the pane. The advantage of doing it all in FotoToon
 is that it would be easier to edit and/or change the text there than if
 it is imported as an image. Some possible ideas for these articles 
could be:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Cooking favorite foods (with recipes)</li>
<li>Family pets (pictures and stories)</li>
<li>Our neighborhood (pictures and stories of places to see or problems that need to be solved)</li>
<li>Science articles with photos of plants, animals, rocks, etc. including descriptions and information</li>
<li>Historical articles with photos of people or places imported from the web</li>
<li>“How To” articles on any topic the students or teacher choose</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modifying FotoToon<a class="headerlink" href="#modifying-fototoon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>FotoToon is free open source software and, as such is available to be
 modified by the user as they wish as long as they give the original

something to suit your needs, you may do so. Just don’t forget to give 
credit where credit is due.</p>
<p>If you are not a programmer, you can suggest changes or modifications
 to the Activity to the original programmer at the same place where you 
would report problems. If it is something that will improve the Activity
 and not interfere with other parts of it, the programmers will be happy
